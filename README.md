# What is this about?
A game made for a personal challenge me and a close friend are running where we create a wide array of games. The goal of this project is to get a solid grasp on Unity and game development as a whole. Both of us are aspiring game developers and are actively working towards becoming full-time indie game developers. 

### How long is the project going to take?
Not sure, the project might only take a few months or maybe the entire year. There are quite a few games each game getting more difficult then the last one. I hope that all games will be able to be completed in 2025, as our goal is not to make Steam ready games, but rather some demo's to quickly prototype ideas aswel as focus on the difficult areas of each project.

### What games can you expect?
I am glad you asked, the following list will explain in more detail what projects are on the timeline. 
| **Genre** | **Description** | **Status** |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Tower defense | A tower defense game where you need to defeat waves of foes, place turrets, upgrade them and keep your endpoint save. The game should include a shop, selling mechanics, placing mechanics and ofcourse, a win/lose condition. | Completed |
| Vampire survivors | The next game in the list, meant to recreate the cult classic called Vampire Survivors, the game uses a lot of UI forcing us to familiarize us with Unity's UI system, a perfect time to think about the UIToolkit and MVC/MVVP | In-progress |
| Card game | Think of Hearthstone, Teamfight Tactics, but then created by a single developer in a limited time. The goal is using the Unity UI as your main gameplay loop. Here we can think of using animations to decorate our project! | Not started |
| Platformer 2D | Moving towards more traditional games, the platformer game is meant to familiarize us with player movement, and game feel. It is also a perfect opportunity to dive deep into the mechanics of a character controller | Not started |
| Shop keeping simulator | Meant to be our first introduction into management games, forcing us to learn more about concepts like inventory systems, management, and NPC behaviours | Not started |
| Platformer 3D | Think of Super Mario Oddessy. Adding a third dimension will increase the difficulty by a landslide. This is a perfect opportunity to learn more about character controllers aswel as Unity's camera systems | Not started |
| Real time strategy | All the focus for this genre would be on NPC behaviour, being able to command your NPC's aswel as fending off against hostile NPC's is a great opportunity to learn more about behaviours, and behaviour trees. | Not started |
| City builder game | A more in-depth focus on management, this game requires to handle a lot of data all at once, a good opportunity to learn more about Unity's new DOTS system. | Not started |
| Boss rush (Fury) | Learn more about complicated enemy behaviours and implement a complicated multi-phase boss fight which the player has to defeat. | Not started |
| Dream game | Now we'd be equipped to start developing on our dream games. The most exciting part! | Not started |

### Can we play them?
Ofcourse, every game will be released on [dorzai.itch.io](https://dorzai.itch.io/), they will be free to play and would love to hear any feedback on how I can improve. My goal is to be as commercially ready to developing my dream game as I can be. My main focus is always perfecting my code which sometimes could also be my downfall.

### Interested in joining?
Let me know, I'd be more then excited to share all this with any of you. Feel free to reach out to me on any of the following social medias.
